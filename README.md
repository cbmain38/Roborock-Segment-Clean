# Roborock-Segment-Clean
# Description
This is to provide instructions and useful tips to perform mutli-segement cleaning of your Roborock vacuum/mop in Home Assistant. This has only been tested on the S8 Pro Ultra.

# Background
The Roborock App allows for the selection of individual rooms or zones to vacuum and mop the selections. The Roborock [Home Assistant Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/roborock/) provides for a very useful interface within Home Assistant, but as noted in the documentation, does not yet provide for individual or multiple segment or room cleaning. [Instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/roborock/#how-can-i-clean-a-specific-room) are included in the integration page to clean individual or multiple rooms and how to identify these rooms in your logs. Identifying your rooms and the corresponding IDs is a pre-requisite to implementing individual or multi-segment cleaning.

## Requirements
1) Your room IDs as identified in [Home Assistant Integration Instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/roborock/#how-can-i-clean-a-specific-room)
2) Input_Boolean Entities for each segment (room) -- These are toggle helpers, see [Input Boolean](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_boolean/) for more information.
3) A Group Helper to contain all of your Input Booleans from #2
4) A Script to perform segment cleaning

### Room IDs
As noted in the background, this is already explained in depth in the Roborock Integration [Instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/roborock/#how-can-i-clean-a-specific-room)

### Input Boolean Entities

### Group Helper
The Group Helper described here is not included in Home Assistant and is not to be confused with the Group Helper you can choose in Home Assistant, as that Group cannot include Input_Boolean entities.
To add a group helper that can include input_boolean entities, there are a few steps:
  1) Include the following line in your configuration.yaml file. This can be done through CLI or through the File Editor Add-On

     <sub>group: !include groups.yaml</sub>

  2) In the same directory as your configuration.yaml file, add a folder named groups.yaml, and add following sample groups.yaml code. Reminder to set the input_booleans specific to your configuration.
